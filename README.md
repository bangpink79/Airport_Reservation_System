At present,travel by air stands as the fastest mode of transportation available.Therefore,there is a pressing need for designing  a comprehensive and user- 
friendly airport reservation system that can streamline the reservation process and enhance the overall passenger experience.
The source code for this project was developed using Python language.We have made extensive use of the tkinter module for designing the GUI and have incorporated 
binary files for storing data.The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive airport reservation system which enables users to book reservations,enquire about made reservations,modify details of reservations and cancel reservations.At present,we have introduced only a limited number of fields of information with passport numbers playing the role of primary key.
